# Using Machine Learning to Estimate the Energy Performance of Residential Buildings # 

This final project aims to develop regression and classification models to evaluate the energy efficiencyof residential buildings. Given eight features of a building, we hope to predict the corresponding *heat loading* and *cool loading*.

    "It aims to solve a regression problem. Given several features of a building, we hope to find a regression model which can predict the energy efficiency of it. The energy efficiency are described by two target variables names *heating load* and *cooling load*. It is important because it could help to design more environemntally friendly buildings from the theoretical perspective.  Real-life energy efficiency experiments of buidings could be both time and effort consuming. "
